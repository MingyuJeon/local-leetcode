# Local LeetCode

This project is designed for individuals who want to solve LeetCode problems in environments where internet access is unavailable, such as on an airplane.
Feel free to add test cases for the LeetCode problem.

## Features

- **Offline Problem Solving**: Prepare the problems you want to solve in advance.
- **Real-time Testing**: Use `ptw` to check if your code passes the tests in real-time.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Prepare the LeetCode problems you want to work on.
4. Run `ptw` to start real-time testing.

Enjoy coding without the need for an internet connection!
